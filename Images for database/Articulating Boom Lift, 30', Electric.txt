JLG articulating booms (knuckle booms) give you up, out, and over positioning capability. Units optionally equipped with articulating jib extensions are also available. Engine options include: electric, gas/LP, and diesel power. The diesel and gas/LP models are suited to rough terrain with better gradeability and are available in 2WD or 4WD configuration. Electric models feature quiet, fume-free operation and are best suited for smooth surface construction and maintenance applications.
