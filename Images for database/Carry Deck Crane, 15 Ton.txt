Carry Deck Crane, 15 Ton
Versatility and utility are yours with Broderson carry deck cranes. United Rentals chose these industrial cranes because they are the toughest in the business. The carry deck area allows you to transport ‘bonus’ loads and eliminates the necessity of traveling with a dangerous, free swinging load out on the hook. Tight spaces are not a problem with the low profile IC20 and IC35; their widths are 4' and 5’. Both cranes have a 90º boom rotation and a 20 sq. ft. cargo deck. Rough terrain cranes from 18- to 35-ton capacity are also available. The width of the IC80 is 6' 6" and the width of the IC200 is 8'; both feature continuous boom rotation and larger load capacities.
